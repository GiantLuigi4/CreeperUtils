[![](https://jitpack.io/v/GiantLuigi4/CreeperUtils.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#GiantLuigi4/CreeperUtils)

A collection of general utils that I use acrossed a large amount of my projects

This project offers a bunch of general purpose utils, such as
    class loading through flame (https://github.com/GiantLuigi4/FlameLoader), logging, dependency management, etc
    objects that hold two objects and can only hold objects of specific types (BiObject)
    file manipulation (eventually)
